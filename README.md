# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

We have built a webpage that allows the user to view randomly generated motivational posters by clicking the Show Another Random Poster button. The user also has the option to make their own poster by clicking the Make Your Own Poster button and filling in the provied form. Users can also save any poster they like by clicking the Save This Poster button. Saved posters can be viewed in mini versions of themselves by clicking the Show Saved Posters button. A user can delete any saved poster by double clicking on that poster. This webpage inspires, entertains, and uplifts visitors of the site.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

First, clone the SSH code from this [link](https://github.com/KarimAl-Rashdan/hang-in-there) to your local computer 
Second, open in your text editor
Third, read the README.md 
Fourth, in the terminal, run the coommand open index.html for initial deployment and interaction with app

### Preview of App:

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

This project was completed during our second week at Turing School. It was our first collaborative project and took us five days to complete.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

- Write clean, DRY JavaScript
- Use a provided class by creating object instances using the new keyword
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
- Begin to understand the connection between HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Practice reading, understanding, and using provided code
- Build an understanding of writing code collaboratively
- Document changes with atomic commits & thorough code reviews
- Communicate, troubleshoot, and plan effectively as a team

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

### Challenges
1. Navigating Git Workflow. When trying to pull from our main branch we found difficulties with merging and resolving conflicts and tried various git commands to work through these conflicts such as: "git fetch", "git branch", "git stash". With practice, we learned to navigate through the git commands.
1. Struggled with reassigning the user input to our current instantiation of our poster class. We overcame this roadblock by collaborating and troubleshooting with fellow Turing students.
### Wins
1. Through this project we learned how to navigate between page views using event listeners on our buttons.
1. We have also learned to manipulate the HTML code within our Javascript code.
